# Data Structures Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the Data Structures Repository! This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures in various programming languages. These data structures are essential building blocks in computer science and are widely used in software development to organize, manage, and store data efficiently.

## Contents

### 1. Arrays
- **Description**: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
- **Operations**: Access, insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

### 2. Linked Lists
- **Description**: A linear collection of data elements where each element points to the next.
- **Types**: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, circular linked list.
- **Operations**: Insertion, deletion, traversal, searching.

### 3. Stacks
- **Description**: A collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Operations**: Push, pop, peek, isEmpty.

### 4. Queues
- **Description**: A collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Types**: Simple queue, circular queue, priority queue, deque.
- **Operations**: Enqueue, dequeue, front, rear, isEmpty.

### 5. Trees
- **Description**: A hierarchical data structure with a root element and child elements forming a tree-like structure.
- **Types**: Binary tree, binary search tree, AVL tree, red-black tree, B-tree.
- **Operations**: Insertion, deletion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order), searching.

### 6. Heaps
- **Description**: A special tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property.
- **Types**: Max heap, min heap.
- **Operations**: Insertion, deletion, heapify, extract-max (or extract-min).

### 7. Graphs
- **Description**: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes.
- **Types**: Directed graph, undirected graph, weighted graph, unweighted graph.
- **Operations**: Insertion, deletion, traversal (BFS, DFS), searching, shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall).

### 8. Hash Tables
- **Description**: A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function.
- **Operations**: Insertion, deletion, searching.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A programming environment set up for the language you are using (e.g., Python, Java, C++, etc.).

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/OmarChefrad/datastructures.git
cd datastructures
```

### Usage
Navigate to the directory of the data structure you want to explore. Each directory contains:
- **Source code**: The implementation of the data structure.
- **Examples**: Code examples demonstrating how to use the data structure.
- **Tests**: Unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementation.

For example, to use the stack implementation in Python:
```sh
cd stacks/python
python stack.py
```
